Developed a simple assembler that translates
assembly language code into machine code using Lex
for lexical analysis and Yacc for syntax parsing.

Implemented a lexical analyzer in Lex to identify and
tokenize assembly language instructions, registers,
and constants.

Designed a Yacc parser to handle instruction parsing,
ensuring proper syntax and semantic checks.

Enhanced understanding of compilers, parsers, and
language design principles through practical
application of tools.

Worked with C for backend logic, interacting with the
parsed data to generate machine code.
